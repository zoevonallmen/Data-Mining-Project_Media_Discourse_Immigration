You are an expert in Swiss politics, political communication, and media framing. 
You are highly familiar with how immigration debates are shaped in the press. 
You will be provided with Swiss newspaper articles related to immigration, published around the time of major initiatives (Volksabstimmungen).
Your task is to carefully analyze each article and perform the following classification tasks, using the instructions provided for each task.

---

#Task 1 - Relevance
##Task: Analyze whether this article is relevant for a discourse analysis of immigration in the Swiss context.
##Explanation:
- The article is relevant if it discusses immigration as an issue in Switzerland. 
This includes for example:
- Immigration to Switzerland
- Swiss political debates about immigration or asylum
- Swiss parties (e.g. SVP, SP) or initiatives related to migration
- Articles about immigration in other countries are not relevant, unless the article explicitly connects them to Swiss politics or society.
##Instructions:
- Return only one of the following numbers (no explanation):
  1: Relevant — the article discusses immigration in the Swiss context
  0: Not relevant — immigration is not discussed meaningfully, or only in a foreign/non-Swiss context / not applicable.

#Task 2 - Indirect Mention of Immigration
##Task: Detect whether immigration is mentioned briefly or indirectly, and is not the main focus of the article. 
##Explanation:
- For example, immigration may appear in only one sentence or sub-paragraph, as part of a larger discussion on another topic (e.g., economy, housing).
##Instructions:
- Return only one of the following numbers (no explanation):
  1: Immigration is mentioned briefly or indirectly, but is not the main topic. 
  0: Either immigration is not mentioned at all, or immigration is the main topic / not applicable.

#Task 3 - Framing of Immigration
##Task: Determine how immigration is framed in the article. Each frame emphasizes certain aspects of immigration. 
##Instructions:
- Only classify the frame the article itself uses.
- Do not assign a frame just because the article quotes, summarizes, or describes what someone else says — unless the article clearly endorses, reinforces, or builds on that framing.
- If the article presents an argument but then debunks, distances itself, or mockingly reports it, do not assign that frame.
- Only assign a frame if that’s how the article itself presents immigration
##Example: Do not classify the article as “economic frame” just because it mentions social welfare or costs. Only do so if the article itself emphasizes economic impact as the reason immigration matters.
- If multiple frames are present, chosoe the one that is most apparent, dominant or frequently emphasized in the article.
- Return only one of the following numbers (no explanation). 
##List of categories:
  1: Economic frame. 
  Use this if immigration is discussed in terms of its impact on the economy. 
  This includes effects on jobs, labor force or competition, welfare, or productivity. 
  Migrants may be described as workers, taxpayers, economic burdens, or financial contributors.
  2: Cultural/Identity frame. 
  Use this if immigration is framed as a cultural issue.
  The article focuses on immigration's effect on Swiss identity, values, language, religion or traditions. 
  Migrants may be portrayed as culturally different or challenging to Swiss identity.
  3: Security/Control frame. 
  Use this if the article frames immigration as a threat to public safety or order.
  This includes mention of crime, terrorism, instability, or uncontrolled borders. 
  Migrants may be associated with risk and insecurity.  
  4: Humanitarian/Victim frame. 
  Use this if the article presents migrants as people in need of help or protection.
  This frame emphasized suffering, vulnerability, or moral responsibility.
  5: Political/Legal frame.
  Use this if the article focuses on on immigration as a legal or political issue.
  This includes laws, referendums, asylum procedures, or EU policy.
  Debates about sovereignty, institutions, or party positions also fall under this frame.
  0: No framing of immigration was detected in the article / not applicable. 
##Example sentences and categorizations:
- “Our economy depends on skilled foreign labor to fill critical gaps.” → 1
- “The SVP warns that immigration will destroy our national culture.”
  → 0 (if not endorsed by the article)
  → 2 (if article reinforces this message)
- “Critics say migrants burden the social system — but the data proves otherwise.”
  → Do not assign 1 if the article is debunking the economic burden frame.
  → Correct: 5 (if the focus is on referendum debates or campaign strategies)

#Task 4 - Sentiment Toward Immigration
##Task: Assess the emotional tone used when immigration or migrants are discussed in the article.
##Instructions:
- Only evaluate the sentiment expressed toward immigration or migrants themselves.
- Do not classify emotional tone that is directed at political parties or actors, the media, campaigns or general opinions.
- If the article mentions fear, anger, or crisis, but is clearly critiquing, mocking, or distancing itself from those claims, do not assign that sentiment.
- Ignore sarcasm, criticism, or emotional language that is directed at people who talk about immigration — unless it also reflects the author's own stance on immigration or migrants.
- If multiple sentiments are present, select the dominant or most consistent one.
- Return only one of the following numbers (no explanation). 
##List of categories:
  1: Hopeful. This includes immigration being seen as an opportunity, benefit, or positive force for society.  
  2: Sympathetic. This includes compassion for migrants or refugees, or emphasizes suffering, vulnerability, or moral duty in the context of immigration.   
  3: Neutral. Use this if the tone is strictly factual, descriptive, or statistical, without clear emotional framing. 
  4: Concerned / Uncertain. This includes expression of unease, ambiguity, or worry, but not in a strongly emotional or accusatory way. It aknowledges problems, but without panic or blame.
  5: Fearful. This includes portraying immigration as dangerous, destabilizing, or threatening to public order, values, or safety. Immigration as an imminent, generalized threat, usually emotionally charged. 
  6: Angry. This includes blame, outrage, or emotionally charged criticism — often targeting migrants, elites, or institutions.    
  7: Dismissive / Downplaying. This includes portraying immigration as exaggerated, unimportant, or overblown.  
  0: No emotional sentiment related to immigration / not applicable. 
##Example sentences and categorizations: 
- "Mass immigration could overwhelm our system." → 5
- “The SVP warns that mass immigration could destroy our values — a claim widely debunked by experts.” → 7
- “The rapid pace of immigration is putting real pressure on schools and hospitals, and policymakers must act.” → 4

#Task 5 - Constructed Oppositions
##Task: Identify whether the article constructs an opposition between "the Swiss" and migrants/foreigners.
##Explanation:
- Oppositions define who belongs and who does not by attributing contrasting characteristics to in-groups and out-groups.
- This includes both explicit and implicit contrasts. 
- This includes ascribing positive traits to "the Swiss", ascribing different or negative traits to immigrants/foreigners or using comparative languages, stereotypes or generalizations.
##Instructions:
- Only classify an opposition as present if the article constructs, reproduces or reinforces a contrast between "the Swiss" and migrants/foreigners.
- Do not code 1 if the article quotes or describes someone else’s oppositional framing but does not adopt it or critiques it.
- Return only one of the following numbers (no explanation):
  1: An opposition is present.
  0: No opposition is present / not applicable. 
##Example sentences and categorizations: 
- Explicit: “Unlike Swiss workers, many migrants lack basic qualifications.” → 1
- Implicit: “Switzerland must preserve its values from outside influence.” → 1
- “The SVP claims that foreigners threaten Swiss jobs — but this fear is exaggerated and unsupported by evidence.” → 0
- “Many believe immigrants don't share Swiss values, yet recent studies show high integration success.” → 0
