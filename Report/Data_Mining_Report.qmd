# Introduction

This paper investigates how immigration is discussed in Swiss media,
specifically in the context of national initiatives and referendums.
Using large-scale newspaper data and employing large language models for
classification tasks, the project analyzes how immigration is framed,
the emotional tone applied to it, and whether oppositional constructions
("us" vs. "them") are present. It focuses media discourses during
moments when political stakes were especially high, which is, during
direct democratic votes, and examines how immigration is discussed by
ideologically differing newspapers.

Building on established literature (Q), the basis of this project is the
assumption, that media plays an important role in the perception of
diverse issues. That is not only through what they cover, but how they
do so. through the use of certain linguistic concepts or the
accentuation of certain aspects. Prior research has shown that media
ownership and political orientation can influence the visibility and
framing of certain topics. In Western Europe, and Switzerland in
particular, immigration has become an increasingly salient and
politicized issue (Q). Over the past two decades, Switzerland has held
numerous initiatives and referendums directly addressing immigration,
such as for example the "Masseneinwanderungsinitiative" (Massimmigration
Initiative) in 2014 or the "Begrenzungsinitiative" (Restriction
Initiative) in 2020. Most recently, the "Swiss People's Party" (SVP)
launched a new initiative, called "Nachhaltigkeitsinitiative", which
again addresses the topic of Swiss immigration.

In a direct democratic country like Switzerland, media discourse is
particularly relevant. As the Swiss people vote directly on these
initiatives, public narratives, influenced by media consumption, can
influence perceptions of migrants and even possibly influence policy
support. Although Switzerland is often seen as a consensus-oriented
democracy, signs of growing affective polarization suggest that media
influence may be evolving (Q). This project further seeks to expand the
discourse analysis by utilizing the recent advances in large language
models to scale up what has traditionally been small-scale qualitative
work. Features such as framing, sentiment, and opposition, which have
often been identified manually before, are now extracted in a more
systematic and large-scale way.

In summary, this project aims to analyze media discourse of
ideologically different media outlets at times where immigration is
especially politicized and stakes are high - during the time of
initiatives. The study therefor tries to answer the following research
question: *How is immigration represented in Swiss media coverage during politically salient moments?* 

More precisely, the following sub-questions should be answered:

-   *What framing strategies and sentiments are used to define immigration and its implications in Swiss media during national initiatives?*

-   *To what extent are oppositions constructed or reinforced in immigration coverage*

-   *How does the use of these concepts vary across ideologically diverse newspapers?*
